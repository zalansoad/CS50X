Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:
The first two, since they have a different result than the ones with higher number of simulations

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:
After 10000 I would call it successful. This would not reach one second at all.
